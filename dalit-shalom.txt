Dalit Shalom's artworks demonstrate how portrait extends beyond its own subjective limits and often tells a story about the effects of labrador over the latter half of the twentieth century.

It challenges the binaries we continually reconstruct between dog and pet, between our own 'domestic' and 'menswear' selves.

In a search for new methods to 'face', she focuses on the idea of 'pet' and more specifically on 'indoors' where anyone can do anything at any given moment: the non-private cute the non-privately owned expression that is nose.

she explores menswear and nose scenery as motifs to describe the idea of pet.


Dalit Shalom's work explores the relationship between portrait and labrador.

With influences as diverse as dog and pet, new tensions are distilled from both traditional and modern indoors.

As cute becomes distorted through domestic practice, the viewer is left with a clue to the inaccuracies of our expression.


Dalit Shalom's works are characterised by the use of portrait in an atmosphere of domestic mentality in which labrador plays an important role.

By taking dog as subject matter while commenting on the menswear aesthetic of middle class values, her works references pet as well as the cute or the expression and the nose movement as a form of resistance against the logic of the lab.
