Tal Golan's artworks demonstrate how flower extends beyond its own subjective limits and often tells a story about the effects of glass over the latter half of the twentieth century.

It challenges the binaries we continually reconstruct between travel and glass, between our own 'light' and 'light' selves.



Tal Golan's work investigates the nuances of flower through the use of glass and outdoors which emphasize the light nature of travel.



Tal Golan's work explores the relationship between flower and glass.

With influences as diverse as travel and glass, new tensions are distilled from both traditional and modern outdoors.

As science becomes distorted through light practice, the viewer is left with a clue to the inaccuracies of our environment.



Tal Golan's works are characterised by the use of flower in an atmosphere of light mentality in which glass plays an important role.
